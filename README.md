# 🏛️ Meridian Vault

**The shared library of AI coding skills, rules, agents, hooks, and MCP configs for [Meridian](https://github.com/skill-field/skillfield-code).**

Every skill you create, every rule you refine, every workflow you perfect — it lives here. Pull what you need, push what you build. The vault grows with every developer who uses it.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v18+) or **Bun** — required for the worker service hooks
- **Python** 3.12 — required for hook scripts
- **uv** — Python package runner used by hooks

## What's Inside

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Rules** | 35 | Coding standards, workflow enforcement, language-specific rules, tool integrations |
| **Commands** | 7 | Slash commands (`/spec`, `/sync`, `/learn`, `/vault`, etc.) |
| **Agents** | 4 | Verification sub-agents (plan-verifier, plan-challenger, reviewers) |
| **Hooks** | 9 | Quality automation (TDD enforcer, context monitor, file checker, etc.) |
| **Modes** | 30 | Localized coding modes (30 languages) |
| **MCP Configs** | 2 | Pre-configured MCP server definitions |
| **Skills** | 1 | Reusable skill packages |

## Usage

### Pull skills from the vault

```bash
# Configure vault (first time)
sx init --type git --repo-url https://github.com/thebotclub/meridian-vault.git
# Note: `sx` is a companion CLI — install via `pip install skillfield-sx`

# Install all vault assets to your project
sx install --repair --target .

# Or from within Meridian
> /vault
> Pull
```

### Push new skills to the vault

When you create a new skill, rule, or command that others could use:

```bash
# From within Meridian
> /vault
> Push

# Or via CLI
sx add .claude/skills/my-skill --yes --type skill --name "my-skill"
```

### Browse the vault

```bash
# List everything
skillfield vault list

# Show details for a specific asset
skillfield vault show <asset-name>

# Or from within Meridian
> /vault
> Browse
```

## Contributing

Every developer using Meridian can contribute to the vault:

1. **Create a skill** — Use `/learn` during a session to extract reusable knowledge
2. **Push to vault** — Use `/vault` → Push to share with the community
3. **Quality matters** — Skills should be well-documented, tested, and genuinely useful

### What makes a good vault contribution?

- ✅ Solves a real, recurring problem
- ✅ Well-documented with clear examples
- ✅ Works across different project structures
- ✅ Doesn't duplicate existing vault assets
- ❌ Project-specific rules (keep those local)
- ❌ Secrets or credentials (obviously)

## Categories Explained

### Rules
Rules are instructions that Claude follows during coding sessions. They're activated automatically based on context:
- **Workflow rules** — How to develop (TDD, verification, handoff)
- **Quality rules** — Code standards, commit messages, reviews
- **Language rules** — Python/TypeScript/Go specific patterns
- **Tools rules** — How to use MCP servers, CLI tools, search
- **Standards** — Conditional standards activated by file type (.css, .tsx, etc.)

### Commands
Slash commands that extend Claude Code with structured workflows. `/spec` for planning, `/sync` for codebase analysis, `/learn` for knowledge extraction.

### Agents
Sub-agent definitions for verification. These run independently to validate plans and review code from different perspectives.

### Hooks
Python scripts that fire automatically on file edits, context changes, and session events. The quality backbone of Meridian.

### Modes
Localized system prompts for coding in 30+ languages. The coding instructions stay in English (code is code), but communication adapts to the developer's language.
